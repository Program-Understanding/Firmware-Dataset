# Firmware-Dataset

We collected 16.9 TB of ﬁrmware images from the ofﬁcial websites of vendors, open FTP sites, and open-source repositories. Currently, 157,141 ﬁrmware images (about 6 TB) from 204 vendors have been pre-processed. The corresponding products of these ﬁrmware images are commonly used in consumer markets, such as networking devices, cameras, and smart home devices. The pre-processing for other ﬁrmware images is still running since these procedures requires a large amount of computation. The pre-processed firmware images are open-source for research purposes, the distribution of their architecture type and OS type is shown in the Figure below. For more details, please see our paper "Work-in-Progress: Measuring Security Protection in
Real-time Embedded Firmware".
